Personal algorithm challenges solutions.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

The `start` script will run the tests for all of the algorithms.
